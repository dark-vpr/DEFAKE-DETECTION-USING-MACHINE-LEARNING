Sure, here's a line-by-line explanation of the selected code:

```python
class validation_dataset(Dataset):
```
This line defines a new class `validation_dataset` that inherits from the `Dataset` class.

```python
def __init__(self,video_names,sequence_length=60,transform = None):
```
This line defines the constructor for the `validation_dataset` class. It takes three parameters: `video_names`, `sequence_length`, and `transform`.

```python
self.video_names = video_names
```
This line assigns the `video_names` parameter to the `video_names` attribute of the class instance.

```python
self.transform = transform
```
This line assigns the `transform` parameter to the `transform` attribute of the class instance.

```python
self.count = sequence_length
```
This line assigns the `sequence_length` parameter to the `count` attribute of the class instance.

```python
def __len__(self):
```
This line defines the `__len__` method, which returns the number of videos in the dataset.

```python
return len(self.video_names)
```
This line returns the length of `self.video_names`, which is the number of videos in the dataset.

```python
def __getitem__(self,idx):
```
This line defines the `__getitem__` method, which is used to get the item at a specific index.

```python
video_path = self.video_names[idx]
```
This line gets the video path at the given index.

```python
frames = []
```
This line initializes an empty list `frames` to store the frames of the video.

```python
a = int(100/self.count)
```
This line calculates the value of `a` as the integer division of 100 by the sequence length.

```python
first_frame = np.random.randint(0,a)
```
This line selects a random frame from the first `a` frames of the video.

```python
for i,frame in enumerate(self.frame_extract(video_path)):
```
This line starts a loop over the frames of the video.

```python
faces = face_recognition.face_locations(frame)
```
This line finds the locations of faces in the frame.

```python
try:
  top,right,bottom,left = faces[0]
  frame = frame[top:bottom,left:right,:]
except:
  pass
```
This block of code tries to crop the frame to the bounding box of the first face found. If no face is found, it simply passes.

```python
frames.append(self.transform(frame))
```
This line applies the transform function to the frame and appends it to the list of frames.

```python
if(len(frames) == self.count):
    break
```
This line breaks the loop when the number of frames equals the sequence length.

```python
frames = torch.stack(frames)
```
This line stacks the frames into a tensor.

```python
frames = frames[:self.count]
```
This line selects the first `self.count` frames.

```python
return frames.unsqueeze(0)
```
This line returns the tensor with an extra dimension added at the beginning.

```python
def frame_extract(self,path):
```
This line defines the `frame_extract` method, which is a generator function that yields frames from a video one by one.

```python
vidObj = cv2.VideoCapture(path) 
```
This line opens the video at the given path.

```python
success = 1
```
This line initializes the `success` variable to 1.

```python
while success:
    success, image = vidObj.read()
    if success:
        yield image
```
This block of code reads frames from the video and yields them one by one until there are no more frames to read.
