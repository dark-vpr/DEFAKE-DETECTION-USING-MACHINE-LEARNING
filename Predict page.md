This Python function [`predict_page(request)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22ml_app%2Fviews.py%22%2C%22predict_page(request)%22%5D "ml_app/views.py") is part of a Django web application and is designed to handle GET requests for a page that predicts whether a video is real or fake. 

The function first checks if the request method is a GET request. If it is, it then checks if the session contains a 'file_name' key. If it doesn't, it redirects the user to the home page of the 'ml_app' application. If the 'file_name' key is present, it retrieves the video file name from the session. It also retrieves the 'sequence_length' from the session if it exists.

The function then prepares the video file for processing. It splits the video file name to get the actual name of the file and checks if the application is running in debug mode. If it's not, it modifies the video file name for production use.

Next, it creates a dataset for validation using the video file and a pre-defined transformation. It also initializes a PyTorch model and loads the model weights from a saved state. The model is then set to evaluation mode.

The function then starts processing the video. It opens the video file using OpenCV and reads the frames one by one. For each frame, it converts the image from BGR to RGB format, saves the preprocessed image, and appends the image name to a list of preprocessed images.

The function also performs face detection on each frame using the face_recognition library. If a face is detected, it crops the face from the frame, saves the cropped image, and appends the image name to a list of cropped face images.

If no faces are detected in any of the frames, the function renders a template with a 'no_faces' flag set to True.

Finally, the function attempts to make a prediction using the model and the video dataset. It rounds the confidence of the prediction to one decimal place and determines whether the video is real or fake based on the prediction. It then renders a template with the prediction results and other relevant information.

If an exception occurs during the prediction process, the function renders a 'cuda_full.html' template. This might be a template that displays an error message related to CUDA, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by Nvidia.

darkvpier: give line by line with code

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a line-by-line explanation of the selected code:

```python
def predict_page(request):
```
This line defines a function named `predict_page` that takes a `request` object as an argument. This function is likely part of a Django web application and is designed to handle HTTP requests for a specific page.

```python
if request.method == "GET":
```
This line checks if the HTTP request method is GET. If it is, the function continues to execute the following code block.

```python
if 'file_name' not in request.session:
    return redirect("ml_app:home")
```
This checks if the session does not contain a 'file_name' key. If it doesn't, the function redirects the user to the home page of the 'ml_app' application.

```python
if 'file_name' in request.session:
    video_file = request.session['file_name']
```
This checks if the session contains a 'file_name' key. If it does, the function retrieves the video file name from the session and assigns it to the `video_file` variable.

```python
if 'sequence_length' in request.session:
    sequence_length = request.session['sequence_length']
```
This checks if the session contains a 'sequence_length' key. If it does, the function retrieves the sequence length from the session and assigns it to the `sequence_length` variable.

```python
path_to_videos = [video_file]
```
This creates a list containing the path to the video file.

```python
video_file_name = video_file.split('\\')[-1]
```
This splits the video file name at each backslash and retrieves the last element of the resulting list, which is the actual name of the file.

```python
if settings.DEBUG == False:
    production_video_name = video_file_name.split('/')[3:]
    production_video_name = '/'.join([str(elem) for elem in production_video_name])
    print("Production file name",production_video_name)
```
This checks if the application is running in debug mode. If it's not, it modifies the video file name for production use.

```python
video_file_name_only = video_file_name.split('.')[0]
```
This splits the video file name at each dot and retrieves the first element of the resulting list, which is the name of the file without the extension.

```python
video_dataset = validation_dataset(path_to_videos, sequence_length=sequence_length,transform= train_transforms)
```
This creates a dataset for validation using the video file and a pre-defined transformation.

```python
model = Model(2).cpu()
```
This initializes a PyTorch model and moves it to the CPU.

```python
model_name = os.path.join(settings.PROJECT_DIR,'models', get_accurate_model(sequence_length))
models_location = os.path.join(settings.PROJECT_DIR,'models')
path_to_model = os.path.join(settings.PROJECT_DIR, model_name)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(path_to_model,map_location=torch.device(device)))
model.eval()
```
This loads the model weights from a saved state and sets the model to evaluation mode.

```python
start_time = time.time()
```
This records the current time, which will be used to calculate the duration of the video processing.

```python
print("<=== | Started Videos Splitting | ===>")
preprocessed_images = []
faces_cropped_images = []
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
```
This prints a message indicating that the video splitting has started, initializes two lists to store the preprocessed images and the cropped face images, and opens the video file using OpenCV.

```python
frames = []
while(cap.isOpened()):
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret==True:
        frames.append(frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
    else:
        break
cap.release()
```
This reads the frames from the video one by one and appends them to the `frames` list. If the 'q' key is pressed, it breaks the loop and releases the video file.

```python
for i in range(1, sequence_length+1):
    frame = frames[i]
    image = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    img = pImage.fromarray(image, 'RGB')
    image_name = video_file_name_only+"_preprocessed_"+str(i)+'.png'
    if settings.DEBUG:
        image_path = os.path.join(settings.PROJECT_DIR, 'uploaded_images', image_name)
    else:
        print("image_name",image_name)
        image_path = "/home/app/staticfiles" + image_name
    img.save(image_path)
    preprocessed_images.append(image_name)
print("<=== | Videos Splitting Done | ===>")
print("--- %s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start_time))
```
This processes each frame of the video. For each frame, it converts the image from BGR to RGB format, saves the preprocessed image, and appends the image name to the `preprocessed_images` list. It then prints a message indicating that the video splitting is done and the duration of the process.

```python
print("<=== | Started Face Cropping Each Frame | ===>")
padding = 40
faces_found = 0
for i in range(1, sequence_length+1):
    frame = frames[i]
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(frame)
    if len(face_locations) == 0:
        continue
    top, right, bottom, left = face_locations[0]
    frame_face = frame[top-padding:bottom+padding, left-padding:right+padding]
    image = cv2.cvtColor(frame_face, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    img = pImage.fromarray(image, 'RGB')
    image_name = video_file_name_only+"_cropped_faces_"+str(i)+'.png'
    if settings.DEBUG:
        image_path = os.path.join(settings.PROJECT_DIR, 'uploaded_images', video_file_name_only+"_cropped_faces_"+str(i)+'.png')
    else:
        image_path = "/home/app/staticfiles" + image_name
    img.save(image_path)
    faces_found = faces_found + 1
    faces_cropped_images.append(image_name)
print("<=== | Face Cropping Each Frame Done | ===>")
print("--- %s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start_time))
```
This performs face detection on each frame of the video. For each frame, it detects the face, crops the face from the frame, saves the cropped image, and appends the image name to the `faces_cropped_images` list. It then prints a message indicating that the face cropping is done and the duration of the process.

```python
if faces_found == 0:
    return render(request, predict_template_name, {"no_faces": True})
```
This checks if no faces were detected in any of the frames. If no faces were detected, it renders a template with a 'no_faces' flag set to True.

```python
try:
    heatmap_images = []
    for i in range(0, len(path_to_videos)):
        output = ""
        print("<=== | Started Predicition | ===>")
        prediction = predict(model, video_dataset[i], './', video_file_name_only)
        confidence = round(prediction[1], 1)
        print("<=== |  Predicition Done | ===>")
        if prediction[0] == 1:
            output = "REAL"
        else:
            output = "FAKE"
        print("Prediction : " , prediction[0],"==",output ,"Confidence : " , confidence)
        print("--- %s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start_time))
    if settings.DEBUG:
        return render(request, predict_template_name, {'preprocessed_images': preprocessed_images, 'heatmap_images': heatmap_images, "faces_cropped_images": faces_cropped_images, "original_video": video_file_name, "models_location": models_location, "output": output, "confidence": confidence})
    else:
        return render(request, predict_template_name, {'preprocessed_images': preprocessed_images, 'heatmap_images': heatmap_images, "faces_cropped_images": faces_cropped_images, "original_video": production_video_name, "models_location": models_location, "output": output, "confidence": confidence})
except:
    return render(request, 'cuda_full.html')
```
This attempts to make a prediction using the model and the video dataset. It rounds the confidence of the prediction to one decimal place and determines whether the video is real or fake based on the prediction. It then renders a template with the prediction results and other relevant information. If an exception occurs during the prediction process, it renders a 'cuda_full.html' template. This might be a template that displays an error message related to CUDA, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by Nvidia.
