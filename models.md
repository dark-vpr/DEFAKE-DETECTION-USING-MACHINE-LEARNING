Sure, here's a line-by-line explanation of the code:

```python
class Model(nn.Module):
```
This line is defining a new class `Model` that inherits from `nn.Module`, which is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch.

```python
def __init__(self, num_classes,latent_dim= 2048, lstm_layers=1 , hidden_dim = 2048, bidirectional = False):
```
This line is defining the constructor for the `Model` class. It takes several parameters including the number of classes for classification, the dimension of the latent space, the number of LSTM layers, the dimension of the hidden layers, and a flag indicating whether the LSTM is bidirectional.

```python
super(Model, self).__init__()
```
This line is calling the constructor of the parent class `nn.Module`.

```python
model = models.resnext50_32x4d(pretrained = True)
```
This line is creating a pretrained ResNext-50 model.

```python
self.model = nn.Sequential(*list(model.children())[:-2])
```
This line is creating a new model by removing the last two layers of the pretrained ResNext-50 model.

```python
self.lstm = nn.LSTM(latent_dim,hidden_dim, lstm_layers,  bidirectional)
```
This line is creating an LSTM layer.

```python
self.relu = nn.LeakyReLU()
```
This line is creating a Leaky ReLU activation function.

```python
self.dp = nn.Dropout(0.4)
```
This line is creating a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.4.

```python
self.linear1 = nn.Linear(2048,num_classes)
```
This line is creating a linear layer that maps from 2048 dimensions to the number of classes.

```python
self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)
```
This line is creating an adaptive average pooling layer.

```python
def forward(self, x):
```
This line is defining the forward pass of the model.

```python
batch_size,seq_length, c, h, w = x.shape
```
This line is unpacking the shape of the input tensor.

```python
x = x.view(batch_size * seq_length, c, h, w)
```
This line is reshaping the input tensor.

```python
fmap = self.model(x)
```
This line is passing the input through the model (the modified ResNext-50 model).

```python
x = self.avgpool(fmap)
```
This line is applying the average pooling layer to the feature maps.

```python
x = x.view(batch_size,seq_length,2048)
```
This line is reshaping the tensor again.

```python
x_lstm,_ = self.lstm(x,None)
```
This line is passing the tensor through the LSTM layer.

```python
return fmap,self.dp(self.linear1(x_lstm[:,-1,:]))
```
This line is applying the dropout and linear layers to the output of the LSTM layer, and returning the feature maps and the output of the linear layer.

```python
class validation_dataset(Dataset):
```
This line is defining a new class `validation_dataset` that inherits from `Dataset`, which is the base class for all datasets in PyTorch.

```python
def __init__(self,video_names,sequence_length=60,transform = None):
```
This line is defining the constructor for the `validation_dataset` class. It takes a list of video names, a sequence length, and a transform function as parameters.

```python
self.video_names = video_names
```
This line is storing the list of video names.

```python
self.transform = transform
```
This line is storing the transform function.

```python
self.count = sequence_length
```
This line is storing the sequence length.

```python
def __len__(self):
```
This line is defining a method that returns the number of videos in the dataset.

```python
return len(self.video_names)
```
This line is returning the number of videos in the dataset.

```python
def __getitem__(self,idx):
```
This line is defining a method that returns the video at a given index.

```python
video_path = self.video_names[idx]
```
This line is getting the path of the video at the given index. However, it seems to be incomplete as it only assigns the video path but does not load or return the video data.
